```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I think the coolest thing about using R has been using it to call an API and writing functions with it.  I've also enjoyed creating graphs using it, too.  Here is a graph I create that displays my Wordle guess distribution.  

```{r , echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
wordle <- read_excel("/Users/danekorver/Documents/danes_wordle.xlsx")

ggplot(data = wordle) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Number_of_Guesses))+
xlab("Number of Guesses")+ 
ylab("Count")+
ggtitle("Guess Distribution")+
scale_x_discrete(limits=c("1","2","3","4","5","6",">6"))+
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,60), breaks = seq(0,60,5))+
theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

```
