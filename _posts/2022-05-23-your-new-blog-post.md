## This is my first blog post
What does it mean to be a Data Scientist? From reading the articles, a Data Scientist is someone that creates questions to 
solve from looking at the data.  Data Scientists must be able to communicate their questions and answers effectively to 
different stakeholders and have a strong math and computer science background.  I think the term "Data Scientist" is just a modern term from the 
traditional term "Statistician," its just they don't put a lot of emphasis on the theory that maybe a traditional Statistician does/did.  
With this is mind, I guess I view myself as a Data Analyst that takes the questions from the Data Scientist and finds the answers and communicates them 
to the different stakeholders.
