# Project 2 blog post

For this project, I decided to use the Financial data APIs.  Originally, I was trying to use the Food API because I wanted to use the query where you enter a few keywords and it would find you recipes based on what you could do with it, but I was struggling to figure out how I could create the required figures and tables with that idea.  I still am going to utilize my new found skills to do that, because I like to try and find recipes where I can use the veggies that I harvest from my garden.  Reflecting on the process, the programming and logic were not my stumbling blocks, it was working with Github that was the hardest part.  For example, inserting images was always troublesome for me, but from the class discussion board, I'm not the only one.  Also, trying to figure out what I wanted to do was also difficult for me and making sure it met the project requirements, hence changing the topic midway.  I'm not sure if that should be considered a time management issue, because that's where the majority of my time was spent for this project.  Writing up the report didn't take me too long.  The one area where I noticed improvement was in my understanding of writing functions in R.  That was one of the reasons why I wanted to take this class.  For some reason, its never really clicked until now.
