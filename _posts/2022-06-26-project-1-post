# Interacting with APIs Project blog post

For this project, I decided to use the Financial data APIs.  Originally, I was trying to use the Food API because I wanted to use the query where you enter a few keywords and it would find you recipes based on what you could do with it, but I was struggling to figure out how I could create the required figures and tables with that idea.  I still am going to utilize my new found skills to do that, because I like to try and find recipes where I can use the veggies that I harvest from my garden.  Reflecting on the process, the programming and logic were not my stumbling blocks, except for inserting images.  Trying to figure out what I wanted to do was the hard part for me and making sure it met the project requirements.  I'm not sure if that should be considered a time management issue or not because that's where the majority of my time was spent for this project.  Writing up the report didn't take me too long.
