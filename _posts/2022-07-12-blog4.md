## Modelling with R

In my class that I am taking this Summer, we’ve been learning to use R.
At the start of the Summer, we learned how to use R to scrape data via
an API, reading it in from a file, and then cleaning it for analysis.
We’ve learned how to use Github as a portal for communicating with other
programmers as a version control tool and also to write this blog! Most
recently, we were learning to use R to model our data using either
simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and tree-based
methods. I enjoyed learning about the tree-based methods, especially the
classification trees with their “bracket” type visuals. We use a
tree-based method to help us identify our predictor variables by
splitting up our predictor space into regions. Here is an example used
in class using the cars dataset with distance as our response variable
and speed as our predictor.
