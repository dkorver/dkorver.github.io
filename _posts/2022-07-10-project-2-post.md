# Project 2 blog post

For this project, we practiced creating predictive models and automating Markdown reports and looked at the [OnlineNewsPopularity dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).  We looked at different characteristics of article sharing between genres ranging from Lifestyle, Entertainment, Business, Social Media, Tech and World.  One of the things that was different between this project and the previous project was that it was a group project.  That was the most difficult part of this project was making sure I stayed in constant communication with my partner.  Trust me that's hard for an Introvert.  I think we succeeded at it.  It was also helpful that I had a great partner.  Surprisingly, using GitHub was not too difficult to use as a repository between the two of us, but we also texted each other when we were done working so that's probably why we didn't have any "merge conflicts."  One thing I would have preferred to do differently was been more involved in the model building, but I could tell tell that she had prior coursework and I was very elementary at it so I was able to learn from her.  I was also trying to work on the project while away from my usual workspace.  The big takeaway from this project is that I'm a little rusty with working in a group.
